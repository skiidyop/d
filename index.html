			<p id="content">I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It was fast paced; zero unnecessary scenes. The action was solid. Morbius himself was well done. Jared Letto did a great job. The villain was spectacular and he worked; they did a good job making them evenly matched with similar abilities. I'd give the movie a comfortable S+ or S-. It is definitely is the best Marvel movie, and it was definitely worth seeing. Especially if you want something darker, more aggressive, and more adult oriented than what Disney gives us.</p>

			<p id="content">This movie is a spectacular masterpiece in cinematic history. The fact that Mario and Morbius make out in the final moments of danger is so beautiful, showing an amazing chemistry. When *Huge Spoiler* morbius kills his grandfather by accident because Snoop Dog made him made me tear up in so many ways. The fights were amazing, I felt like I was creaming in 4d. It deserves morquadrillion dollars. If you dont like this movie your fatherless. One of the best fights is when Morbius was fighting ken the barbie doll. Not only that but Morbius is so relatable. The scene when Morbius dropped the soap while singing kumulala kumulala savesta really touched my heart and felt super super dopey dingle tingle relatable to my life and every way of living. Morbius is a marvel legend.</p>

			<p id="content">Amazing. No other words.  A bold showing on the theory and practice of collective oligarchies. A consumerist masterpiece that shows the function of a capitalist world built off of democracy. In every moment the screen fills up with action, not only from the main character. It should win an Oscar for its screenplay. The amazing factors might be from the hyper-realistic animation Or the magnificent plot. The plot involves an emoji. Amazing plot right? Whoever thought this should be made deserves a medal. This is the best animated of the 21st century. Easily beats every movie in its path. This movie made me dedicated to my present job, being an emoji. The antagonist is a totalitarian ruler who lives for money and fame only. Any person caught making the wrong face gets eliminated. the climax is the fellow emojis coming in to save the day. after I watched it in the theater I felt something I had never felt before. Pure 100% joy. This film needs a follow-up ASAP. I have never in my life seen a better movie. The film's soundtrack consists of works better than the likes of Elton John, The Beatles, Queen, and any other group/solo artist(s). I felt like I was in the world of emojis with all the realistic details around the landscape. This movie grasps its audience and does not let go. The captivating story, the amazing music, the idea of the movie itself, the screenplay, landscape, random details, Easter eggs, all of those reasons mentioned are just SOME of why I love this movie. The trailer is fantastic, and I love the ending of the dance! A critic's DREAM. We follow the main character through land after land, app after app, including candy crush, Twitter, DropBox, Just Dance, message apps, Facebook, pirates bay, Spotify, and so much more! They included tutorials for the game, to try and get us to play the game! Some people say this is just a long ad, and they are right. As a consumerist, I don't mind this! This movie is so enjoyable it feels as if you are flying to your happy place! 10/10. Would watch it again 7 times! A modern classic that in the future will be looked at as nostalgia! If you see this at the bargain bin, PLEASE, buy it. This movie is too good to look over. It's insane how the director can make this good of a movie! We need a Sequal, live-action remake, musical, everything! Watch this masterpiece, and you will agree with make. thank GOD for this movie! My emotions went insane for this movie! I can not believe how they made a movie about emojis turn into the entertainment powerhouse! I love emojis I want to be an emoji so much, I love it! The emoji movie is cool I love it!  please let my family go hahaha. The emoji movie has so many stunning backgrounds it's amazing! I love emoji movies so much! THE EMOJI MOVIE HAS SO MANY RELATABLE CHARACTERS I LOVE!</p>
